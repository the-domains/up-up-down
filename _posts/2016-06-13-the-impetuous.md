First pass, first post.

This part is about the voice, the interests, the depth to which I will share my soft underbelly to the carnal tribe of miscreants and the calibration of my intents and wishes. 

Small indescribable anguishes haunt me at this moment as I'm stretched thin, self-consciously nervous, about relating. ![Jimmy Mezei's probably friendly on the hooch](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e93488c00572f7cfb614cf1768161b108ff4486b.jpg)

Whiskey? Late night rants; casual relatability through casual swearing on a topic anchored by musty, crusty men and bouyed by bearded bespec'd hipsters. 

Coding? An endless landscape of opinions barren of sensitivity, stymied in tradition while modern in privilage; fun if you're looking to roll up your sleeves and constantly be wrong; maybe this is a saga! Laptop ronin and their search for lords for the concession of their honor and loyalty?

Games. Cardboard, digital. A pass time not often imbued with righteous importance but always a potential for indignance. Boxed experiences allowing, _incentivizing,_ acting beyond personal and social comfort, making the meek mighty and the dull boisterous, without lasting consequences.

Food. So basic a concept and need and most fetishized of necessities. The politics, the history, the cultu---ah, boring, okay, okay, never mind. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/c3f930dd-fe64-4ec2-b3c1-67131f09de15.jpg)

But we'll see where we land and what comes of this.
